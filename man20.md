### Notes
## THE RÉGIMA ZONE CONCEPT
### ULTIMATE ANTI-AGEING
The core concept of the Zone range is the 3 spheres of influence:
• Anti-inflammatory

• Anti-oxidants

• Rejuvenation
The 2 main causes of skin ageing and ageing diseases are ‘the silent kill-er’ inflammation, and free radical damage. Zone products address individ-ual skin issues, with active ingredients targeting each contributing factor at maximum clinically effective concentrations seen in the relevant trials, whilst nor-malising every other skin function to its ideal condition, achieving equilibrium by influencing these factors, bringing skin into the Zone of optimal skin health.
### ANTI-INFLAMMATORY

Inflammation is the body’s response to injury. The inflammatory response that is trig-gered within the skin also results in the destruction and re-creation of cells.

The inflam-matory response within the body is responsible for the generation of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, which result in the actual inflammation of cells, and in turn the associat-ed reddening, swelling and pain. Anti-inflammatories are important for reducing the pro-inflammatory response, thus reducing the damage caused by inflammation.
### ANTI-OXIDANTS

Oxidation within the body is responsible for cell damage and the ageing of skin as it triggers the creation of damaging molecules called free-radicals.

Internally these can start a chain of chemical reactions, potentially causing damage not only to individual cells, but also DNA. Anti-oxidants are extremely important for fighting free-radical species, and preventing oxidation that can trigger this cell damage.
### REJUVENATION

Rejuvenation in the context of skin is bound within the concept of skin renewal.

Skin rejuvenation as a process involves not just readjustment, but the overall re-structuring of the skin, to produce perfectly formed and healthy cell development. While this initially may imply desquamation of cells giving way to the development of healthy replacement cells, there is a lot more involved in ensuring the stable, regiment-ed development of cells that ultimately produce smoother, younger looking skin.

## SUNSCREEN
Why we need to always use our Sunscreens!
Otherwise you could become a human Gucci leather handbag!
### Notes
Warning: Sunscreens with very high SPFs (50 or higher) offer the promise of longer protection, but in real life, they don’t work any better than a SPF 15. The following is true: SPF 15 blocks 93% of the sun’s UVB rays SPF 30 blocks 97% SPF 50 blocks 98% SPF 100 that number stays at 98% A major problem is that high-SPF products also tempt one to stay out in the sun longer, which increases the risk of skin damage.

High-SPF products also contain greater amounts of sun-blocking ingredients, chemi-cals, than low SPF sunscreens. These ingredients may pose health risks. It is better to use a sunscreen with SPF of 15 to 25 and reapply more often.
In real life, people apply one-fifth the amount of sun-screen used in the laboratory SPF tests (Autier 2003, Azurdia 2001, Reich 2009). This means that someone who applies one-fourth as much sunscreen as in the SPF test gets just SPF 2.3 protection from an SPF 30 product. SPF 100 becomes just SPF 3.2. The fact that people use less sunscreen than recommended is not an argument for using even higher SPF products to compensate.

Higher SPF products produce small increases in real-world SPF. But even this small change allows sunbathers to stay in the sun lon-ger – and absorb more overall radiation – before a sunburn sends them indoors. In the process, the substantially greater amounts of sunscreen chemicals in higher SPF products can penetrate the skin and lead to much higher internal exposures to potentially hazard-ous compounds. The user is left with a burn and a significantly higher “body burden” of sunscreen chemicals. What’s wrong with high SPF? Theoretically, applying SPF 100 sunscreen allows beachgoers to bare their skin to sunshine a hundred times longer before causing the skin to burn.
Young Woman With Skin Cancer - Be Aware That Skin Cancer Does Not
Only Affect Mature Or Sun-damaged Skins
### Notes
a burn would appear. But for high-SPF sunscreens, theory and re-ality are two different things. Studies have found that users of high-SPF sunscreens have similar or even higher exposures to harmful UV rays than people relying on lower SPF products as they trust the product too much, stay in the sun longer with a single application and get burned when the product’s chemicals break down, wash off or rub off on clothes and towels. Armed with a false sense of security, they ex-tend their time in the sun well past the point when users of low-SPF products would. The following are the very latest FDA regula-tions:-NO MORE SPF 100: Often, people grab what-ever sunscreen is labelled with the highest SPF and assume it’s the best protection out there. It was that misleading fact that sparked the FDA to make “SPF 50+” the highest rating allowed on a product. Why? According to the American Academy of Dermatology, an SPF 15 product blocks 93 percent of UV rays. Most people wrongly focus solely on the SPF factor within a product when deciding what would be the best choice of skin protection.

SPF means “sun protection factor” and refers only to protection against UVB radiation, which causes burning, inflammation and damage of the skin which is all visible to the naked eye. It has nothing to do with UVA radiation that penetrates deep into the skin, accelerates skin ageing, “the silent killer”, as it can cause skin cancer. This UVA burning is not visi-ble. The SPF statement is only a measure of how well the sunscreen deflects UVB rays. Also consider that SPF ratings are calculated under perfect laboratory conditions with the volunteer applying the correct amount of product. Other ingredients within sun-screens are very important natural protectors such as Vit C. Since the introduction of sunscreens and sunblocks skin cancer rates began to climb and not fall. For example, melanoma rates doubled from 6 to 13 per 100,000 people since 1973.
Bottom Line People stay out in the sun much longer because they are wearing high SPF so they feel they are totally protected when they are not, leading to ageing sun damage and potential skin cancers
### Notes
PERFECT UVA + UVB ULTIMATE SUN PROTECTION A Combination of the very Finest, New, High Technology Sun Screening Actives. Régi-mA Protects against Burning UVB + UVA – The ‘Silent Killer’. Note: Broad Spectrum Sunscreens Do NOT always protect against UVA rays.
WHY CHOOSE RÉGIMA ZONE TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED ‘NEW AGE’ SUNSCREENS?

• Show 95% less free radicals in comparison with other UV filters even those at higher con-
centrations

• RégimA combined sunscreens work in synergy for the most well-balanced protec-
tion. When used in combination they provide UVA and UVB for the most effective long-term skin protection, protecting against free radical exposure as well as ery-thema (redness) from sunburn

• Protects the skin’s natural anti-oxidant defence systems, this combination of sun-screens perform better, protect for longer

• Most efficient oil soluble broad-spectrum UV filter

• Boosts the effectiveness of combined UVB filters, with lasting protection

• Produces the highest contributions to SPF and UVA protection factors

• Acts as an SPF booster for UVB filters improving SPF level

• Extremely low skin penetration so safer, yet exceptionally high absorptivity of UVB
radiation, so smaller concentrations are needed to achieve a high SPF value. Ex-hibits the highest photo-stable absorption of all available UVB filters
Uvinul A Plus

• In terms of protection against free radicals, Uvinul A Plus shows 95% less free radicals
(at 3.5%) in comparison with other UV filters at the same or higher concentration

• Uvinul A Plus would require more than double the amount of UV exposure to result
in the formation of free radicals in the skin, and therefore produces better anti-free radical performance at the same or lower concentrations

• Works in synergy with Uvinul T150 for the most well-balanced daily protection re-gime – when used in combination, it guards against UVA and UVB for the most effective long-term skin protection by protecting against free radical exposure as well as erythema from sunburn

• The use of self-tan increases subsequent UV exposure, often resulting in three times the amount of free radicals formed. The use of Uvinul A Plus in conjunction with self-tanning applications completely suppresses the resulting boosted free radical exposure, as well as reducing the level of free radicals in the untreated skin below. Additionally, Uvinul A Plus when used in conjunction with self-tanning applications reduces the level of free radicals by 92% below that of skin treated with self-tan-ning applications alone.

• The skin contains its own anti-oxidative defence system, consisting of enzymatic and non-enzymatic anti-oxidants such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascor-bic acid and tocopherol. UV induced radiation can damage these anti-oxidant
### Notes
the skin’s own anti-oxidative protection.

• Utilised at an SPF of 6, Uvinul A Plus (in conjunction with Uvinul T150) resulted in bet-ter performance, protecting the skin’s natural antioxidative defence system better than tested market products at levels between SPF 15 and 30. Even at low con-centrations, Uvinul A Plus outperforms competitive UV filters, protecting the skin’s natural defence systems better, and for longer.

• Higher concentrations of Uvinul A Plus, boost the effectiveness of combined UVB fil-ters at increasing scale, without additional stabilisation. This means utilising a high-er concentration of Uvinul A Plus results in boosted UVB filter performance, without any adjustment of UVB filter concentration.
Tinosorb S

• Most efficient oil soluble broad-spectrum UV filter

• Exhibits lasting protection due to its excellent photostability. Even after 50 MEDs
(Minimal erythmal doses), 98.4% remains intact.

• Produces the highest contributions to SPF and UVA protection factors at low con-
centration

• Acts as an SPF booster for UVB filters such as Uvinul T150, improving SPF level by use
in combination

• Helps to avert molecule degradation caused by photons present in the sun’s UV
rays. This photostability enhances the sunscreen’s effectiveness in protecting the skin, and protects other sunscreening agents present in formulations
Uvinul T150

• Extremely stable towards light. Remains practically unchanged, even when ex-
posed to intense radiation.

• Shows a good affinity with keratin in the skin, providing some water resistant prop-
erties. This is further enhanced by its complete insolubility in water.

• Exceptionally high absorptivity of UVB radiation, the result of which is that only small
concentrations are needed to achieve a high SPF value. It exhibits the highest photo-stable absorption of all available UVB filters

• Extremely low skin penetration
## ßETA-ENDORPHIN STIMULATOR
INCORPORATED INTO:
Daily Radiant Boost, Daily Ultra Defence, Sensorial Daily Protector, Daily Intelligent Sebum-Solver

• This compound is a new technology ingredient, a phyto-endorphin casticin, with a unique activity, a ßeta-endorphin stimulating complex.

• This activity is actually responsible for producing a sense of wellbeing, and appli-cation will leave the skin feeling smoothed, refreshed and moisturised.

• ßeta-endorphins are small peptide neurotransmitters that are mainly produced in the pituitary gland and the hypothalamus of the central nervous system where they bind to opioid receptors in the brain, creating a sense of wellbeing.
### Notes
modulate migration of keratinocytes and to even be involved in wound healing. This medicinal plant, indigenous to the Mediterranean region, has been shown to produce lipophilic substances that bind to the mu-opiate receptor and to stimu-late ßeta-endorphin production in vivo.

• Both ßeta-endorphins and opioid receptors have been detected in skin cells, and it has been found that the topical application of ßeta-endorphin stimulators ac-celerates skin regeneration and wound healing and exerts a posi-tive effect on skin hydration, firmness and wrinkle depth.
Liposomes deliver a ßeta-Endorphin Stimulating Complex, a new tech-nology ingredient with unique action, producing a sense of wellbeing on application, leaving the skin feeling smoothed, firmer, refreshed, moisturised with improved radiance. Promotes skin regeneration and anti-wrinkle activity.
24-HOUR ‘CHRONOACTIVE’
INCORPORATED INTO:
Daily Ultra Defence, Sensorial Daily Protector

• A ‘chronoactive’ material, that prevents premature skin ageing efficiently and
continuously over 24 hours.

During the daytime it dims oxidative stress induced by the solar spectrum, while at night it provides prolonged protection from free rad-icals, building up the skin’s anti-oxidant defence mechanism, and reducing radi-cal formation leading to further reductions in oxidative stress. Its properties mimic those of natural skin anti-oxidant defence mechanisms efficient at free radical scavenging and stable

• It provides advanced protection for the epidermal lipids and truly photo-stabilizes UV filters

• It is the ideal partner for the UV filter systems used in sunscreens and day-care cosmetics as its activity continues long after exposure to the sun has ceased, ex-tending overnight

• Testing was performed to assess its ability to also reduce acne formation (a prob-lem that can be exacerbated by certain sunscreens). Eight week results showed a 25% improvement in reduction of skin inflammation and erythema, and a 20% reduction in skin oiliness after 8 weeks. Sensorial Daily Protector recommended for the oilier skin types, who require a more matte finish. Daily Ultra De-fence for the dry skin types.

• It is as efficient as tocopherol and as stable as tocopherol acetate. However, it also has numerous other properties. In fact, the real ef-ficacy of this substance starts where the activity of conventional ingredients such as anti-oxidants or UV filters ends.

### Notes
## ANTI-AGEING SERUM
As one ages skin regeneration slows down, the epidermis (outer layer of skin) becomes thinner and epidermal nerve endings decrease, the complexion loses luminosity, facial features ap-pear tired and wrinkled. However, when instructions from our genes are activated and converted into proteins, they per-form essential functions as enzymes, hormones and receptors, promoting epidermal recovery, this is called ‘Gene Expression’. Genes are segments of our DNA and they work like instruction manuals for our bodies, essential in the fight against the ageing process. RégimA Zone Epi-Genes Xpress epito-mises multifunctional anti-ageing ex-cellence. How was this achieved? A winning combination of the most ad-vanced technologies in one magical product. Actives used at maximum efficacy help stimulate renewal, lead-ing to a thicker, healthier looking, en-ergized, more youthful epidermis. There has been found to be a link be-tween nerve degeneration and epi-dermal thinning.

To the rescue is a topical booster, derived from an Afri-can seed, clinically proven to reverse the natural loss of nerve fibres, which occurs with ageing, and has been shown to enhance epidermal innervation, stim-ulating nerve regrowth, helping to fight epidermal thinning, which directly impacts visibly on the outer skin, smoothing and brightening. Probiotic supplements are renowned for supporting the immune system via the gut. What about topical benefits? The usual way is to apply good bacteria to destroy bad micro-organism growth on the skin, calming and beneficial for acne. However, the most innovative topical, anti-ageing jewel to conjure with, is an advanced, extremely pro-active, probiotic, from specialised fermented bacterium. Clinical human studies prove RégimA’s choice of probiotic uniquely activates ‘gene expression’, accelerating healthy epidermal renewal. Results reveal a smoother, thicker skin with significant reduction in wrinkle depth. The unique synergy of actives, in this deliciously luxurious product, significantly reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, skin is visibly smoother, thicker and more resilient, bringing back the all important youthful glow. RégimA has found the X Factor.

### ACTIVE INGREDIENTS:
• UNIQUE PROBIOTIC - Uniquely Activates ‘Gene Expression’ Thickens Skin Probiotics are known for helping problematic skins by eliminating bad bacteria. However, this unique probiotic has been proven to increase the production of anti-microbial pep-tides, induces skin renewal, accelerating skin barrier recovery. Trials were undertaken on female human volunteers aged between 47 and 63 years old. Test products containing this Probiotic were applied twice daily for 2 weeks. After the 2 weeks tape stripping was performed to remove stratum corneum and induce skin damage. Following this the Probiotic was again applied twice daily for a further 4 days. The thick-ness of the stratum corneum was determined by a Vivascope 1500 laser and at different time points after tape stripping. Measurements of stratum corneum were made 1 hour, 2 and 4 days after tape stripping. Accelerated skin growth was clearly demonstrated. The TEWL (trans epi-dermal water loss) is established with a Tewameter TM 210, again measured after tape stripping and was compared to skin not treated or tape stripped, at 1 hour, and after 2 to 4 days. Results clearly showed an increased rate of recovery of a healthy barrier function.

• AFRICAN SEED EXTRACT - Helps reverse the natural loss of nerve fibres and Stim-ulates nerve regrowth
This special seed, cultivated for its nutritional qualities, rich in proteins, vitamins, and mineral salts, has proven to greatly contribute to skin well being. It has been scientifically proven that nerve endings influence the proliferation (new cell production), differentiation and survival of keratinocytes (skin cells).

Scientific results highlight the major influence of nerve fibres on the formation of thicker, healthier, more youthful skins With age, skin becomes no longer innervated, which means the nerves shorten, be-come inactive and diminish. It has now been proven that this lack of, or inactivity of, nerve endings, has impact on the epidermis, making it thinner.

• Innervation = To stimulate a nerve to activity

• Neuritogenesis = The power to regenerate nerve fibres
### Notes
Results were ascertained by various methods including confocal microscopy, visual-isation of epidermal living layers by desmoplakin immuno-staining. Results proved that one can now help reverse time through science as trials show this particular African Seed Extract has the ability to boost the neuritogenesis in the epider-mis.

When applied topically there is reversal of natural degradation of nerve fibres and growth restarts. In vivo testing epidermal thickening has visibly been proven to increase, the epidermis is re-boosted, skin becomes smoother, brighter, more energised.

### ANTI-INFLAMM-AGEING
Sensitive skin is characterised by an impaired skin barrier, with inflammation being triggered more easily, causing the skin to quickly become red, hot, itchy and inflamed. An inflammatory response to irritants is the body’s natural protective reaction, but unfortunately in the repeated responses of hypersensitive skins, this can come at the price of premature skin ageing. Inflammation, allergic responses causing itching, scratching and tissue damage can be disfiguring, cause physical discomfort and anxiety for the affected individuals, worsening quality of life.

Chronic inflammation includes eczema, psoriasis, and even neurodermatitis. People may scratch affected areas during the day without realizing it. They may also scratch whilst sleeping. Usual-ly, neurodermatitis causes a skin outbreak that
doesn’t get any bigger, but the irritated skin can grow thick and deep-ly wrinkled. Infections may also develop in the irritated areas. However, there is main emphasis on what is labelled ‘Sensitive Skin’, affecting a large number of people, and means even small stimuli trigger inflam-matory and immune reactions, leading to a vicious circle: The inflammatory response triggers additional cell damage induc-ing a progressive deterioration of the skin barrier, creating substantial collateral damage.

Sensitive skins can rapidly develop sensations such as burning, itching, tightening, reddening, which can result in subsequent scarring and, unfortunately, premature ageing. Inflammatory processes can have a significant impact on skin ageing. This fact is reflected in the term inflamm-ageing or in-
Photos show telangiectasia, couperose (broken capillar-ies) typically over the cheeks, sometimes also nose and chin
### Notes
However, with advancing age, we pay the price as the immune system pro-duces more inflammatory messen-gers. It is characterised by underlying, on-going processes, which permanent-ly stress the skin and slowly, but inexora-bly, cause damage. Skin ageing gains momentum, ‘behind the scenes as such’ under the surface, and successful anti-ageing is made more difficult. Harsh chemical ingredients, or those that are known potential triggers for causing inflammation, must always be avoided.

External scrubbing agents are totally contraindicated as these will take early broken capillaries, which are reparable, telangiectasia, to chronic couperose, resulting in visible rosacea. The reduction of inflamm-ageing, or slowing its development, can significantly help sensitive skins and enhance the prevention of skin ageing. To counteract inflamm-ageing, the stimulus threshold for sensitive skin must be increased and inflammatory processes controlled. To the Rescue, RégimA Anti-Inflamm-Ageing

flammation. Protects and reinforces barrier function, firming, toning, anti-sagging.

Protects against oxidative stress and provides all important Anti-Inflamm-Ageing. The main objective is to fight against chronic low grade inflammation and it’s visible consequences on skin ageing via 3 different pathways: 1. Inhibition of NF kappaB activation and cytokine release:
Acts against mediators of inflammation. What is NF Kappa?: (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) is a protein complex that controls transcription of DNA, cytokine production and cell survival. Transcription is the first step of gene expression, in which a par-ticular segment of DNA is copied into RNA (especially mRNA) by the enzyme RNA polymerase.

Both DNA and RNA are nucleic acids, which use base pairs of nucle-otides as a complementary language. NF-κB is found in almost all animal cell types and is involved in cellular responses to stimuli such as stress, cytokines, free radicals, heavy metals, ultraviolet irradiation, oxidized LDL, and bacterial or viral antigens. NF-κB plays a key role in regulating the immune response to infection. Incorrect regulation of NF-κB has been linked to cancer, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, septic shock, viral infection, and improper immune development.
2. Inhibition of plasmin serine protease: Skin barrier protection 3. Inhibition of neuropeptide release by activated peripheral sensory nerve endings:
Action against neurogenic inflammation. The action on these 3 pathways, complete with an anti-oxidative effect, results in a perceivable improvement on skin biomechanical properties as well as a good pro-tection of the epidermis by enhancing the skin barrier function. The visible effects of the age-related loss of elasticity, firmness and tonicity such as the ones involved in skin sagging, are delayed. Trials on this ingredient showed significant restorative effects against age-related degradation, loss of elasticity, firmness and tonicity involved in skin sagging.

The for-mulation reinforces the skin barrier integrity,improving the ability of the skin to act as a barrier against exogenous factors (ie. Smoking and sun damage). It was further shown to inhibit the vicious cycle induced by chronic low grade inflammation, mini-mizing the visible signs of skin ageing. (It is noteworthy that this Patented Formulation protects nerve endings from in-flammation and Epi-Genes X-Press stimulates nerve regeneration = A Perfect Combination of these 2 products, particularly for the over 40s)
PICHIA ANOMALA YEAST (Patented ingredient of Natural Origin – Eco-Friendly) Rich in yeast bio-peptides, oligopeptides, regulates communication between cells to limit Inflamm-ageing. It promotes dermal matrix restructure.

Deeply moisturising with a concentration of natural vi-tamins and fatty acids provides a remedy for dry, super sensitive skins, keeping skin essentially more supple, calmer, reduced redness and in-flammation as well as improving fine lines and wrinkles, maintaining skin in a more supple, youthful condition. Has also been found to improve skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, inflamed skin rashes. SUNFLOWER OIL CONCENTRATE (HELIANTHUS ANNUUS) Made of plants from certified organic cultivation, particularly high in lip-ids, a valuable source of bioactive components such as phytosterols, as well as being rich in nutrients such as calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc and vitamins A, K and E. It is used effectively against inflammation and general irritations of the skin. Being very high in vitamin E, it acts as an emollient which traps moisture and
keeps skin well hydrated. It also helps prevent damage to cells by ultraviolet light and aids against premature aging of skin by protecting the collagen and elastin content. Sunflower is a source for beta-carotene, which is converted to vitamin A with benefits of protection from sun damage and free radicals.

Omega-6 (linoleic acid) which is found in sunflower oil, assists with cell development and treating disorders such as eczema, acne and scarring. TRIALS: After 28 days of application of the combined patented ingredients, results showed significant restorative effects against age-related degradation of, loss of elasticity, firmness and tonicity involved in skin sagging. Proven to improve and protect the abil-ity of the skin to act as a physical and mechanical barrier against exogenous factors.

This ingredient is a force to be reckoned with.
### Notes
vides multiple anti-ageing benefits. Protects cells from UV damage, im-proves skin tone whilst promoting healthy collagen synthesis, resulting in a stronger, resilient, clearer, brighter, more even-toned, smoother complexion. An increase in oxidative stress wreaks havoc on skin health, hindering
collagen synthesis and speeding up collagen breakdown, higher photo-damage, resulting in increased melanin production.

As a result, skin visibly ages, with wrinkles, roughness, ‘age spots’ uneven pigmentation, reduced skin brightness and a decline in skin hydration. Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate Vitamin C acts at a cellular level increas-ing cell survival, collagen synthesis, ensuring skin hydration.

• UV Protection - UV exposure increases inflammation in the epidermis and dermis,
damaging the DNA. UV rays increase melanin production and skin thickness, but not in a good way, resulting in a skin that is thick, coarse, full of wrinkles, and pig-mentation.

Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate achieves excellent penetration within the skin keratinocytes, fighting harmful effects of UV radiation. Cells treated with Ascor-byl Tetraisopalmitate have a better survival rate.

• Melanocytes - Produce melanin, a dark pigment, which protects skin from UV damage. However, too much of this pigment can result in a darkened, patchy, complexion. Ascor-byl Tetraisopalmitate helps reduce melanin production, resulting in skin brightening.

• Collagen - With age and exposure to environmental toxins and pollutants, skin loses collagen reserves. However, all is not lost, Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate helps promote healthy collagen synthesis as well as causing a decline in the activity of collagen-degrading enzymes.

• Multi-Functional - Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate is a potent anti-ageing, antioxidant, melanin suppressing, and collagen boosting skincare ingredient with an impressive safety profile.
SUPER OILS - Leading the super oils within this package is Camellia, secret of the Geishas, rich in Omega 3, 6, 9, Vitamins A, B, D, this precious commodity has the identical molecular weight as skin, ensuring rapid absorption. Together with Hazlenut, Apricot, Rosehip and Blackcurrant Oils, “On Q” is a winning anti-ageing combination.
CAMELLIA SINENSIS SEED OIL – Secret of the Geishas Camellia, from the Japanese Goto Islands, a most treasured secret of the Geishas, renowned for centuries for restorative and rejuvenating ef-fects. Rich in Omega 3, 6, 9, Vitamins A, B, D, this precious commodity has the identical molecular weight as skin, ensuring rapid absorption.

APRICOT KERNEL OIL (Prunus Armeniaca) Apricot Kernel Oil is rich in oleic and linoleic acids (essential fatty acids), and is known for its ability to penetrate the skin without leaving an oily feel.

It is also a smooth and lightweight oil that has an excellent texture that is great for all skin types. It is also high in mono and polyunsatu-rated fatty acids, and contains Vitamins A, B1, B2, B6 and Vitamin E, is
readily absorbed into the skin without leaving a greasy residue.

It is particularly bene-ficial for dry, mature skin. Although no oil can “nourish” skin from the outside, the fatty acids and sterols in apricot kernel oil help to moisturize the outer layer of the skin and minimize the effects of photo-aging, or sun damage.

• Has a lipid content similar to that of skin. When the skin’s lipid content becomes
too low, dry, irritated skin results so topical application of apricot oil helps soothe and repair rough, damaged skins. The oil’s fine texture allows more rapid skin pen-etration, which promotes relief of itchy and irritated skins
ROSEHIP (Rosa Canina Fruit Oil) Vitamins A.B,D,E and C, flavonoids; tannins; sugars; acids; pectin, ca-rotenoids (lycopene). Anti-oxidant, astringent, anti-viral, diuretic.

• Linoleic Acid – Helps to preserve the cell’s natural barrier to the environment and is vital for the structure of cell membranes. This is an omega 6 fatty acid.

• Oleic Acid – An omega 9 fatty acid, this helps to create supple and moist skin and improve overall skin condition.

• Linolenic Acid – This is an omega 3 fatty acid and it may help to improve skin conditions by softening and moisturising the skin. It is also important for the structure of cell membranes.

• Lycopene – This is an antioxidant and it protects the skin from free radical dam-age, reducing the risk of premature ageing.

• Beta-carotene – A source of pro vitamin A and an antioxidant to help improve the appearance of sun damaged skin. It can also help to prevent the signs of ageing.

• Vitamin C – This is an antioxidant that protects against free radical damage. It also plays a role in the formation of collagen.
Rosehip oil is a very rich source of essential fatty acids – in fact; it is 80 percent fatty acids. These are vital for regenerating skin cells, and repairing skin tissue.
### Notes
Rosehip oil is a fantastic moisturiser as it will moisturise the dry areas of your skin whilst not adding too much moisture to oilier areas. Rosehip oil can be used by anyone of any age.

Because it has balancing properties, it can be used by both dry and oily skins, and it allows the skin to breathe. All skin types can benefit from rosehip oil
BLACKCURRANT SEED OIL (Ribes Nigrum Seed) Aside from a high content of vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid), the berries contain flavonoids, including quercetin, myricetin, and kaempferol and at least 15 different phenolic acids, including anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins.

Works preventatively to help stabilise changes in the skin. It is an anti-dermatitis, anti-inflammation and anti-acne oil that may help to keep minor skin problems at bay by fighting bacteria.
With high levels of omega-3 fatty acids, this oil is an ideal remedy for the skin. Gam-ma-linolenic acid is well known to reduce inflammation in the skin, whilst also minimiz-ing the signs of ageing, thanks to its antioxidant quality.

This can reduce the appearance of wrinkles, age spots, and blemishes. It’s a fantastic oil for use on skin particularly if one suffers from inflammation, eczema and uneven skin tone.

Derma Sensitive]

• PASSION FLOWER [PASSIFLORA INCARNATA FLOWER EXTRACT] Flavonoids are free radical scavengers with powerful anti-oxidant activity, particularly after oxidative stresses induced by sun radiation or pollution. There is also a softening, calming, relaxing properties as Passion Flower acts on skin microcirculation. Tests were conducted on human volunteers and this produced a decrease in facial flushing and soothing effect

• SARCOSINE, CINNAMOMUM ZEYLANICUM BARK EXTRACT Human trails revealed after 8 weeks skin becomes clearer, less oily, more matte. Regulates sebum rate, reduces the number of comedones. Mutlifunctional acts on the main causes of cutaneous imbalance: 5-Alpha Reductase Inhibitor - Regulation of sebum production Anti-Elastase Activity - Elastase propagates inflammation and breaks down the tissue matrix = breaks down elastin. Helps prevent bacterial proliferation

• MEADOWSWEET EXTRACT – 5 ALPHA-REDUCTASE INHIBITOR WHAT DOES A 5-ALPHA-REDUCTASE INHIBITOR DO? - One of the main causes of acne is androgens, which are male hormones present in both men and wom-en and a peak in testosterone can cause hormonal breakouts. They enlarge the sebaceous glands in the skin and cause these glands to increase sebum pro-duction exacerbating plug formation and serves as “food” for bacteria. Hormone imbalances are greatly indicative as a trigger for acne both Youth & Adult. Testosterone turns on the glands that produce sebum. One way to control testoster-one is to control the enzyme that stimulates its production. This enzyme is called 5 alpha-reductase, which converts testosterone into a more powerful form. By inhibiting this enzyme, one can reduce testosterone levels within the skin, importantly without affecting the hormones within the body.

• EXTRACT FROM CAPER BUDS - OCTYLDODECYL MYRISTATE, CAPPARIS SPINOSA FRUIT
EXTRACT - DERMA-SENSITIVE [Gemmotherapy – Oily Active Extracted From Caper Buds] Trials were performed for 4 weeks, applying topically twice daily, using human females with sensitive, reactive skins. There was a significant improvement, particularly parameters of comfort and redness associated with reactive skins.

The volunteers showed a clear difference before and after treat-ment. The significant improvement encompasses sensations of stinging, burning, redness, suppleness and general comfort of the skin, parameters associated with reactive, irritated and environmentally stressed skins.

### PIGMENT PERFECTOR
HAZARDS OF SKIN LIGHTENING CREAMS: HYDROQUINONE The most common bleaching ingredient used in skin lightening creams and is also found in film developing products, it is popular in Asian and African cosmetic markets as it is a strong inhibitor of melanin production, but it comes at a price. In January 2001 hydroquinone was banned from over-the-counter cosmetics in the European Union.

In the US, hydroquinone can be obtained at 2% over counter and 4% on prescription but illegal preparations at a potentially lethal 25%, sometimes mixed with corticosteroids, mercury and various additional caustic agents, are still available on the black market. Manufactured primarily in European and Asian countries, places where many of the active bleaching agents are banned from sale, Africa has become a dumping ground yet, thriving market for products deemed dangerous if not lethal .

• Prolonged use of Hydroquinone thickens collagen fibres resulting in a rough,
blotchy, spotty appearance

• It accumulates in the skin

• Black market hydroquinone based products can cause severe birth defects, still-
birth and can be lethal to the mother

• Must not be used during breastfeeding as is toxic to the baby

• Severe allergic reactions to the ingredients in skin bleaching creams include burn-
ing, itching, and lesions on the skin. Skin may flake or crust

• Pre-Laser preparation several years ago used to be Hydroquinone and Retin-A. In many
cases this combination caused pigmentation within 2 weeks prior to laser therapy

• If worn in intense sunlight, it can cause permanent nerve damage

• Prolonged hydroquinone use can result in a disfiguring skin condition called ochro-
nosis in which the skin is marked with blue-black discoloration
### Notes
and thick with greyish-brown/black spots, or more advanced, blue/black patches, particularly around the eyes, cheeks and mouth, and can occur in people who have used hydroquinone for a short time. Studies report abnormal function of ad-renal glands and high levels of mercury.

The damage is almost impossible to re-move. With continued use skin becomes like rhino hide. Note the dramatic tearing / stretching of the skin on the woman in pink 2 CASES – SKIN LIGHTENING CREAM CAUSING WEIGHT GAIN AND STRETCH MARKS FROM CORTICOSTEROIDS

• Doctors in the UK were confused by symptoms presented by a woman where there was
no reason for her weight gain, stretch marks and inability to conceive.

She eventually admitted using a skin lightening product, Clobetasol, banned in the EU, containing high levels of corticosteroid. She far exceeded the recommended usage, using two tubes of Clobetasol a week for over seven years and developed the unexplainable symptoms

• This is a case of a 28-year-old woman that had been using a skin lightening formulation con-taining corticosteroids. She presented to her Dr with weight gain and being unable to get pregnant. She denied taking any illegal or prescription drugs but eventually admitted to using a skin lightening cream
SUMMARY:
• Whitening agents such as Kojic acid can potentially damage healthy cells, Whereas the
lightening compounds in this formulation provide the same level of anti-pigmentation ac-tion, without harming viable cells, providing much greater safety with the same efficacy.

• The lightening ingredients in this formulation have several separate effects to achieve superior anti-pigmentation results: skin lightening (tyrosinase inhibition, reduced melanin synthesis), skin brightening (smoothed skin surface and even tone), a “flash effect” for radiance (increased light reflection from improved skin micro-relief), and an increased skin luminosity effect (optically activated particles)

• Several separate tyrosinase and melanin reducing effects work in combination: an anti-tyrosinase action, tyrosinase stabilisation, tyrosinase inhibition, reduction in melanin quantity, and reduction in melanin synthesis. The combination of these separate effects results in incredible anti-pigmentation power.

• Use twice daily and combine with ‘Power Peels’ for more rapid results

• Each active that has been included in this formulation provides its own anti-pig-
mentation effect, so that when used in combination they provide a synergistic and cumulative lightening capability
MELANOGENESIS: Melanogenesis is a series of enzymatic and chemical reactions in the body, trig-gered by UV-induced radiation and stress. This stress activates the enzyme Tyrosinase, which begins the cascade of reactions that result in the production of melanin.
### Notes
ways ask clients if they are taking specific medi-cation. Your CLIENT RECORD CARD is critical, not only for skin treatment history, but ANY medical history. Eg. Certain medications for rheumatoid arthritis can cause pigmentation. Tyrosinase inhibition occurs when another ex-ternal factor (Lumiskin, Black Tea extract, Chi-nese Sophora root, Kiwi Fruit extract, Ascorbyl Glucoside) inhibits the initial enzyme Ty-rosinase from triggering melanogenesis, and thus preventing the reaction cascade. Tyrosinase inhibition can occur in several ways, most often the external factor will inhib-it Tyrosinase directly, preventing the reaction. Another method of Tyrosinase inhibition is to compete with the same receptor sites that Tyrosinase attaches itself to, preventing the reaction by not allowing Tyrosinase to attach to an available receptor site. ‘PREGNANCY MASK’ – Also known as MELASMA or CHLOASMA: FIGHT IT DURING PREGNANCY, DON’T WAIT There is a lot of misinformation out there with some people believing that they must wait until a couple of months following delivery to start trying to eliminate the horrible ‘Pregnancy Mask’. It is NOT TRUE that one must wait until a while after the birth, and that nothing can be done, as the condition can only get worse during that time without intervention.

RégimA is offering the safe solution with home care and in-salon treatments. We all know that when a woman is pregnant her hormones change, often resulting in development of blotchy areas of darkened skin on their faces, ‘Chloasma’, more commonly known as ‘Pregnancy Mask’. Do Not Despair, Do Not Just Accept It, but it will not disappear without help - Do Not Wait, act immediately once you and your clients see this developing. ‘Nip it in the bud’ RégimA has a Perfect Solution! To either prevent, or help elimi-nate ‘Pregnancy Mask’, Apply Pigment Perfector AM and PM as well as Omega High Impact or Rejuvoderm Night Maintenance in the evenings. RégimA Power Peels are also SAFE during preg-nancy to further help prevent or treat this problem. This anti-pigmentation treatment draws on the individual strengths of multiple skin lightening actives. The combined effect of these actives, each providing their own anti-pigmentation effect, create a synergistic and cumulative lightening, brightening capability second to none. With state of the art technology, Lumiskin [and its main functions], Sophora Root extract and the enhanced lightening action of black tea extract and the latest in stabilized Vitamin C technology, this product combines the most cutting-edge actives for unpar-alleled skin lightening power. Added to this, Kiwi Fruit Extract has been found to be particularly beneficial for under-eye dark circles. MAIN FUNCTIONS:
• Significant Tyrosinase Inhibition

### Notes
should barrier the sensitive areas: lips, upper eyelids, nostrils, groove of the nose (unless there are blackheads that one wishes to target) Power Peels can be applied with the fingers (if ungloved wash hands thoroughly following application) straight from the pump container. This allows the doctor or therapist great con-trol over the areas to be treated and less product is used. Ap-ply across the forehead, down the nose (avoiding the whole eye area), Cover the cheek area from the cheekbone downwards to the jawline and back towards the ears. DO NOT go higher than the cheekbone until the last few minutes of the treatment. Carefully apply to the chin as close to the lips as possible without touching them. Apply slowly and carefully above the upper lip, again avoiding the skin on the lips. If the neck is to be treated apply from side to side with downward strokes Once application is complete CHECK THE TIME. One may then take the Laser Azu-Repair and massage around the treated areas for a few seconds (avoiding the eye area) to relieve itchiness. BUT ONLY if the client is in extreme discomfort.

If one is going to be applying to the under eye area allow for a maximum of 5 minutes before the end of the treatment and ask the patient/client to look upwards to the ceiling, and apply Power Peel with the fingers to the under eye area from the inside outwards, but not close to the eye. CHECK THE TIME The Power Peel must be thoroughly neutralized with RégimA cleanser. Ideally the patient/client should stand at the ba-sin. The first cleanse should be done with a wet sponge and cleanser and the therapist massages quickly around the face and neck, avoiding the over eye area. The patient/client must then wash thoroughly several times without a sponge. They should then be asked to do the “Lick Test” to check if there is any bitterness or fruity taste. If there is still bitterness present then a further wash is necessary Once the neutralization is complete and there is no taste of bitterness then the skin should be dried gently but thoroughly. Before the application of any post peel products ask the patient/client to stroke their skin to feel the immediate smoothness Immediately following the peel eye products may be applied, then Scar Repair Forte Super Strength Serum to be applied to all treated areas, face, neck, décolleté. This may be followed by one of the RégimA leave on treatment Masques if desired.

### Notes

• Cleanse with RégimA Derma Zest - Renders skin more penetrable

• Barrier with Laser Azu-Repair to lips and nostrils. Only if the upper eyelids are crepey,
apply a very thin layer of Gel on them. Never apply Laser Gel under the eyes, as the peel needs to be applied to the under eye area on most clients for the last approximately 3 to 5 minutes.

• With Fingertips, Apply A Thickish Layer to Face & Neck If Desired, + Back Of Hands - Apply in precise strokes, applying slight pressure, pushing the peel into the skin. With each area, apply sufficient peel - Across the forehead, down the nose, crows feet, do a semi-circle from the corner of the nose to the crows feet area. Do NOT go near to the eyes at this stage (leave like a panda eye area free to start). Re-member if you go Too High, Too Soon, Too Late. Go down each cheek with strokes, again, applying sufficient peel, across the chin area, close to the lips, carefully apply above the upper lip.

• There MUST Be A Visible Sticky Residue Or Not Enough Peel Has Been Applied

• If Neck has sun damage, pigmentation, acne, scarring then always treat the Neck
at each session. Warn the client that the skin MAY look worse before it looks better, due to the peeling, separation from the healthy living layer to the outer dead layer as it sloughs off. Ensure they have Laser Azu-Repair with their home care

• DO NOT Massage the peel in as this will remove it – leave the residue

• DO NOT Apply Laser Gel – Unless Client Is In Extreme Discomfort

• Start timing immediately following application – Generally 10 to 20 minutes,
but judge each client separately: If someone has moved up from 30 to 50 Pow-er Peel the timing would be judged the same, with each client having different re-actions one must be flexible. Carefully monitor client – if there are signs of ‘frosting’ /peeling, then remove immediately

• Neutralise Thoroughly with Derma Zest and sponges or mitts if unable to neutralise standing at the basin

• Do the ‘Lick Test’, asking client to lick around the mouth and onto the chin To En-sure No Bitter or Fruity Taste. If bitter, Cleanse the full face and neck again. Cleanse the Hands

• If there is Visible Peeling - Apply a thickish layer of Laser Azu-Repair and gently mas-sage, leaving blue residue

• Masque - SpaZone – Leave On If Desired

• Massage – The Combination of Laser Azu-Repair + Active Facial Oil are Divine –
Leave On Or Remove As Desired depending whether further treatment products are to be applied

• RégimA Home Care - If there is any visible peeling Laser Azu-Repair MUST be part of the home care until all peeling has ceased

• Inform the client not to apply Omega High Impact or Rejuvoderm Night Mainte-nance for 2 nights following the Peel. They may use either Laser Azu-Repair, Scar Repair Forte Serum, or Quantum Elastin-Collagen Revival for those 2 nights, until any peeling has ceased.
SAME PROTOCOL FOR RAPID-REJUVO MASQUE & ‘ACNE ATTACK’ PRO-MASQUE – Thick-ish Layer Essential
### Notes
It is extremely important that you and the clients/patients know the reasons why we have introduced the combination treatment. Please all watch the videos of the pro-tocol and the Double Whammy.

The Acne Attack Pro Masque is the Most Powerful BETA PEEL on the mar-ket – Peeling and Healing. When com-bined with the 50 Power Peel it quickly achieves amazing results. Recommended for treatment of:
• Active Acne – Youth or Adult

• Acne Scarring

• Irregular Pigmentation

• Sun Damage

• Wrinkles and Skin Ageing Why? Because it Contains:
• 30% SALICYLIC ACID – BETA HYDROXY

• 12% LACTIC ACID – ALPHA HYDROXY

• MEADOWSWEET – Normalising Hormones within the skin

• PHYTELENE COMPLEX: This botanical complex
– Watercress, Burdock,Ivy, Sage, Lemon Fruit, Saponaria - Provides 4 types of activ-ity: sebo-regulating, preventing bacterial development, clearing skin, stimulating skin micro-circulation. This combination of selected plants work synergistically.

• PRO-VITAMIN B5

• HYDROGENATED POLYDECENE COMBINED WITH

• 50 Power Peel = Contains just under 60% combination of 6 Natural Acids The Power Peels have more lightening, brightening power, than Hydroquinone, without any side effects. Power Peels are a thicker consistency and cannot be applied with cotton wool, gauze or a brush. Same applies to the Acne Pro Masque. A thickish layer MUST be applied, no massaging, no Laser Gel over the top. Other Beta Peels on the market are just salicylic acid usually with nothing or very little else. The Acne Beta Peeling Masque is thick and, like the Power Peels, should be applied with the fingers. It is powerful and not self-neutralising like most. It gives us much more control on just how much peeling we want to achieve. In-Salon/Spa Options For Masques:
• SpaZone O2-Radiance Luminocity Masque

• SpaZone Marine Replenishing Peptide Masque

• SpaZone Urban Stress Protect + Detox Clarifying Masque

• SpaZone Neck + Breast Refining Complex Masque
These peels will not make the skin more sun sensitive, however, it is always recommended that one apply a RégimA product with UVA/UVB protection to prevent damage caused by the harmful effects of the sun. pH of Power Peel 30: 1.87 pH of Power Peel 50: 1.22

### Notes
## PRO-MASQUE
IN-SALON TREATMENT Stand Alone Treatment OR Part of Double Whammy Treatment
A fast acting Masque designed to safely help unblock con-gested, problematic and acneform skins. Salicylic Acid in high percentage, coupled with Lactic Acid, are a perfect power-ful combination for helping eliminate active acne, and lev-el acne scarring. Lactic acid is smoothing and rejuvenating whilst being known to have impact on hyperpigmentation.

Selected botanicals, including Watercress, Burdock, Sage, Lemon, Ivy, Soapwort, work synergistically providing par-ticular benefits for oily problem or inflamed skins, sebo-regulating, anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, accelerates healing, calms, sooths, has a ‘natural antibiotic’ effect. Meadowsweet helps control oil secretion, cleverly bal-ancing hormones within the skin, without affecting hor-mones in the body and providing antiseptic action. MAIN FUNCTIONS:
• Beta Hydroxy Action Unplugs Blocked Pores

• Alpha Hydroxy Exfoliates And Improves Texture

• Rapid Exfoliation

• ‘Flash Effect’

• Instant Radiance

• Skin Smoothing

• Firming

• Anti-ageing

• Anti-inflammatory, Anti-oxidant

• Anti-bacterial, Antiseptic

• Beneficial For All Skins And Particularly: Ageing Skins, Sun Damage,
Sun Spots, Pigmentation, Blackheads, Acne, Eczema, Psoriasis ACTIVE INGREDIENTS:
• Salicylic Acid - 30%

• Meadowsweet

• Plant Complex: Watercress, Burdock, Sage, Ivy, Soapwort

• Hydrogenated Polydecene – Deeply Hydrating

• SALICYLIC ACID - 30% - BETA HYDROXY ACID ACTION From the willow tree Beta Hydroxy acid exfoliates and decongests within the sebaceous pore. While BHA’s penetrate deeper into the pore than AHA’s, it can be less irritating than AHA’s. This is due to BHA’s relation to aspirin. Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) has anti-inflammatory properties and the BHA’s, salicylic acid, is derived from aspirin and on the skin, retains some of its same anti-inflammatory benefits. Perfect, well tolerated treatment for congested skins.

### ELASTIN-COLLAGEN REVIVAL
### Notes
gin. It is generally recognized that lactic acid is the best performing hydroxy acid and it is therefore a first choice of RégimA. Of all AHAs and BHAs, lactic is one of the most skin friendly and exhibits excellent cell renewal activities. Lactic exhibits additional properties as well, it moisturizes and possesses the ability to increase ceramide levels.

Lactates are safe and mild and can achieve a significant skin lightening effect. Lactates can be used successfully in combination with other NATURAL AHAs. Lactates work synergistically with Vitamin C with a reported skin lightening result. Formulating at a lower pH, as with the strictly NATURAL acids, there is an increased effectiveness in lightening with better penetration and exfoliating action.

• MEADOWSWEET EXTRACT – 5 ALPHA-REDUCTASE INHIBITOR WHAT DOES A 5-ALPHA-REDUCTASE INHIBITOR DO? - One of the main causes of acne is androgens, which are male hormones present in both men and women and a peak in testosterone can cause hormonal breakouts. They enlarge the sebaceous glands in the skin and cause these glands to increase sebum production exacerbating plug formation and serves as “food” for bacteria. Hormone imbalances are greatly indicative as a trigger for acne both Youth & Adult. Testosterone turns on the glands that produce sebum. One way to control testosterone is to control the enzyme that stimulates its production. This enzyme is called 5 alpha-reductase, which converts testosterone into a more powerful form. By inhibiting this enzyme, one can reduce testosterone levels within the skin, importantly without affecting the hormones within the body.

• PLANT COMPLEX: WATERCRESS, BURDOCK, SAGE, IVY, SOAPWORT - Botanical com-
plex associates 4 types of complementary activities: Watercress – Watercress is a good source of beta-carotene, two important compo-nents in preventing UV-damage and maintaining skin health, which is key to anti-age-ing. It may also help in treating eczema, acne, and generally problematic skin. Con-tains many anti-oxidants, vitamins A, C, E and several B Vitamins. Burdock - Anti-bacterial, antiseptic, and anti-inflammatory properties, a safe natural remedy for assorted skin conditions, including eczema and psoriasis. It has also shown to be effective for dry skins and related conditions, such as dermatitis. Sage - Rich in Calcium and Vitamin A.

Anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, shown to be ben-eficial for eczema, psoriasis, acne. Anti-ageing. Ivy - Anti-inflammatory. A main topical action is that of a circulatory compound, which helps other ingredients to be absorbed by the skin, as well as assisting with the remov-al of waste products from the skin. Has been known to help eczema, psoriasis, acne due mainly to the anti-inflammatory properties. Soapwort - Helps eczema and dry itchy skin. Saponins are natural surfactants, they provide soapy, cleansing properties.

• HYDROGENATED POLYDECENE Problematic skins also require hydration, but without oiliness. In long term studies on human volunteers, polydecene was applied twice daily to evaluate the efficacy in skin hydration, skin barrier function, clinical scoring of dryness, induration/softness, scal-ing and roughness. In all the individuals the polydecene showed an increase in stra-tum corneum hydration compared to the untreated control.
### Notes
sun-damaged, ageing or scarred skins where breakouts are not a problem. Natural unbuffered AHAs provide more free acids, are more easily absorbed, provide en-hanced rapid healing and less irritation. Beta hydroxy acid is lipid (oil) soluble. This means that beta hydroxy acid is able to penetrate into the pore which contains sebum and exfoliate the dead skin cells that are built up inside the pore. Beta hydroxy acid is better used on oily skin with black-heads and whiteheads. Free Acid Availability? RégimA only uses Natural acids so the free acid value is high and is shown in the naturally very low pH.

Pure Natural acids are naturally stable (no chemical interven-tion is required), they are the most biodegradable and efficient with the most rapid absorption. What does it mean if a peel claims to be buffered? Stabilising / buffering chemicals are used in synthetic peels to bring the pH up to around 3. These chemicals used in buffered formulations are usually what cause rapid or exces-sive peeling – eg. ammonium hydroxide (drain cleaner). RégimA does not buffer peels. STAR INGREDIENTS:

IN-SALON TREATMENT A fast acting multifunctional Super Rejuvenating Masque, swiftly, safely, effectively, smooths the skin leaving it silky soft with a healthier youthful glow. An anti-ageing bo-tanical complex combines plants which were selected for their synergistic and com-plementary activities, ensuring hydration stability, activates skin micro-circulation, helps stimulate elastin and collagen synthesis, whilst protecting against free radicals. A synthesized biomimetic version of a hydroxy acid naturally present in Royal Jelly, rapidly, significantly decreases the number of active sebaceous glands, is antibac-terial, inhibits development of P. Acnes bacteria and is anti-ageing.

Meadowsweet helps control oil secretion, cleverly balancing hormones within the skin, without affecting hormones in the body and providing antiseptic action. Lactic Acid combats pigmentation as well as rapidly exfoliating, smoothing, rejuve-nating. Salicylic Acid unblocks congested skins as well as rejuvenating. Penetrating Pro-Vit B5 stimulates fibroblast proliferation and repair with deep moisturisation. MAIN FUNCTIONS:
• Alpha Hydroxy – Exfoliates And Improves Texture

• Beta Hydroxy Action Unplugs Blocked Pores

• Rapid Exfoliation

• ‘Flash Effect’

• Instant Radiance

• Skin Smoothing

• Firming

• Anti-ageing

• Anti-inflammatory, Anti-oxidant

• Anti-bacterial, Antiseptic

• Beneficial For All Skins And Particularly: Ageing Skins, Sun Damage, Sun Spots, Pig-
mentation, Blackheads, Acne, Eczema, Psoriasis ACTIVE INGREDIENTS:
• Lactic Acid

• Salicylic Acid

• Meadowsweet

• Plant Complex: Watercress, Burdock, Sage, Ivy, Soapwort

• Complex including: 10-Hydroxydecanoic Acid Clinically Tested Royal Jelly Mimic

• Hydrogenated Polydecene – Deeply Hydrating

• LACTIC ACID – NATURAL UNADULTERATED (UNBUFFERED) ALPHA HYDROXY ACID ACTION Is the mildest and most effective AHA available and is derived from milk or of plant origin. It is generally recognized that lactic acid is the best performing hydroxy acid and it is therefore a first choice of RégimA. Of all AHAs and BHAs, lactic is one of the most skin friendly and exhibits excellent cell renewal activities. Lactic exhibits addi-tional properties as well, it moisturizes and possesses the ability to increase ceramide levels. Lactates are safe and mild and can achieve a significant skin lightening effect. Lactates can be used successfully in combination with other NATURAL AHAs. Lactates work synergistically with Vitamin C with a reported skin lightening result. Formulating at a lower pH, as with the strictly NATURAL acids, there is an increased effectiveness in lightening with better penetration and exfoliating action.

### Notes
ceous pore. While BHA’s penetrate deeper into the pore than AHA’s, it can be less irritating than AHA’s.

This is due to BHA’s relation to aspirin. Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) has anti-inflammatory properties and the BHA’s, salicylic acid, is derived from aspirin and on the skin, retains some of its same anti-inflamma-tory benefits. Perfect, well tolerated treatment for congested skins.

• MEADOWSWEET EXTRACT – 5 ALPHA-REDUCTASE INHIBITOR Testosterone is a main cause of hormonal breakouts as it turns on the glands that produce sebum. One way to control testosterone is to control the enzyme that stim-ulates its production. This enzyme is called 5 alpha-reductase, which converts testos-terone into a more powerful form. By inhibiting this enzyme, one can reduce testosterone levels within the skin, impor-tantly without affecting the hormones with the body.

• PLANT COMPLEX: WATERCRESS, BURDOCK, SAGE, IVY, SOAPWORT - Botanical
complex associates 4 types of complementary activities: Watercress - Watercress is a good source of beta-carotene, two important com-ponents in preventing UV-damage and maintaining skin health, which is key to an-ti-ageing. It may also help in treating eczema, acne, and generally problematic skin. Contains many anti-oxidants, vitamins A, C, E and several B Vitamins. Burdock - Anti-bacterial, antiseptic, and anti-inflammatory properties, a safe natu-ral remedy for assorted skin conditions, including eczema and psoriasis. It has also shown to be effective for dry skins and related conditions, such as dermatitis. Sage - Rich in Calcium and Vitamin A.

Anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, shown to be beneficial for eczema, psoriasis, acne. Anti-ageing. Ivy - Anti-inflammatory. A main topical action is that of a circulatory compound, which helps other ingredients to be absorbed by the skin, as well as assisting with the removal of waste products from the skin. Has been known to help eczema, psoriasis, acne due mainly to the anti-inflammatory properties. Soapwort - Helps eczema and dry itchy skin. Saponins are natural surfactants, they provide soapy, cleansing properties.

• PROBLEM SKIN COMPLEX: INCLUDES 10-HYDROXYDECANOIC ACID (10-HDA, se-
bacic acid and decanediol). Is a synthesized bio-mimetic version of a hydroxyl acid present in Royal Jelly.

Clinically tested Royal Jelly mimetic that controls and reduces sebum for acne prone skin. A unique active ingredient aimed at re-establishing the physiological balance, partic-ularly in acne-prone skin.

• HYDROGENATED POLYDECENE In long term studies on human volunteers suffering from dry skin and atrophic skin dis-position, polydecene was applied twice daily to evaluate the efficacy in skin hydra-tion, skin barrier function, scaliness and clinical scoring of dryness, induration/softness, scaling and roughness. In all the individuals the polydecene showed an increase in stratum corneum hydration compared to the untreated control. AHAs & BHAs: Alpha hydroxy acids are water soluble only. AHAs are better used on thickened, sun-damaged, ageing or scarred skins where breakouts are not a problem. Natural
### Notes
Beta hydroxy acid is lipid (oil) soluble. This means that beta hydroxy acid is able to penetrate into the pore which contains sebum and exfoliate the dead skin cells that are built up inside the pore. Beta hydroxy acid is better used on oily skin with black-heads and whiteheads. Free Acid Availability? RégimA only uses Natural acids so the free acid value is high and is shown in the natu-rally very low pH. Pure Natural acids are naturally stable (no chemical intervention is re-quired), they are the most biodegradable and efficient with the most rapid absorption.

What does it mean if a peel claims to be buffered? Stabilising / buffering chemicals are used in synthetic peels to bring the pH up to around 3. These chemicals used in buffered formulations are usually what cause rapid or excessive peeling – eg. ammonium hydroxide (drain cleaner). RégimA does not buffer peels. STAR INGREDIENTS:

## SCARS
4 PHASES OF WOUND HEALING Day 1 to 3 Phase 1: Haemostasis Stop Bleeding
Day 3 to 20 Phase 2: Inflammation New Frame Work for Blood Vessel Growth
Week 1 to 6 Phase 3: Proliferation or Granulation Pulls the Wound Closer
Week 6 to 2 Years Phase 4: Remodelling or Maturation Final Proper Tissue
CLASSIFICATION OF SCARS:
• There is a broad spectrum of scar types, ranging from a ‘normal’ fine line scar to
a variety of abnormal scars

• Types Of Abnormal Or Poor Scars Are:
• Hypertrophic and Keloid scars (raised, lumpy scars)

• Atrophic (Indented scars), Acne and Chicken pox scars

• Stretch marks
### Notes
Scars that manifest as pink, red, purple, itchy, painful, raised and usually remain in that condition for years if untreated What Is The Difference Between Hypertrophic & Ke-loid Scars? Hypertrophic follows the incision line, keloid also infil-trates into surrounding tissue Worst Areas For Scarring? Over bony areas, joints, shoulders, earlobes, jawline, the sternum (breast bone) is the worst Scars That Can Be Helped By Scar Repair Forté? Operative, trauma, burn scars, acne scarring, stretch marks, old skin grafts, old lumpy scars HOW SCARS ARE FORMED:
• Scars form following any event that damages the skin tissue

• Scars do not form in the same manner as the surrounding
tissue due to the body’s defence mechanism that ensures the wound is closed in a short time

• This often results in an overproduction of collagen

• These collagen deposits will often appear raised above
the surrounding skin, and are hard, fibrous bundles, often blocking the regeneration of normal tissue

• Scars can be formed as a result of different types of injury such as, trauma, surgery, burns, acne or any other form of rupturing the skin

• Scarring is unpredictable and varies from person to person FACTORS THAT AFFECT SCARRING: There are many factors influencing scar develop-ment / healing that can affect the appearance of the scar formed.

• The simplest factor to consider is the health of the
person in its entirety. It stands to reason that if the body is lacking in nutrients critical to the healing process, this healing process will be prolonged, and potentially result in a badly formed scar.

• Smoking, substance abuse, genetics, diseases and immunological factors are all potential mod-ifiers for the healing process, and ensuring the in-fluence of these factors is reduced to a minimum is essential to ensure this process is unhindered.

• Age is another important factor, due to the gradu-al changes in skin physiology that all people experi-ence with age. As one matures, the body’s ability to produce collagen is reduced. This actually means that the older someone is, the less likely they are to produce larger hypertrophic scars, which are influ-enced by collagen production.

### Notes
er age, and often scarring that occurs in one’s earlier years is exacerbated by the body’s increased natural defence capacity, rapid, overproduction of col-lagen in young people may result in hypertrophic scarring.

• Many other factors are influential in scar formation: en-vironment, severity of trauma, diet, even one’s skin type. However, of these factors, the one which falls within our greatest sphere of control is the treatment thereof. Scar treatment and care holds great value in determining the final resulting appearance of the scar.
HYPERTROPHIC AND KELOID SCARS:
• Hypertrophic and Keloids are the most common forms of scarring

• Caused by excessive collagen production as the body attempts to repair the damage

• Both manifest as pink, red, purple, itchy,
painful and raised

• Whether it is following acne, trauma or surgery,
a younger client has a higher chance of de-veloping hypertrophic or keloid scars due to the over production of collagen in young skins

• Keloid scars differ from hypertrophic. Hyper-trophic scars follow the incision line whereas a keloid infiltrates into surrounding ‘normal’ tissue

• Keloid scars develop mainly in females, between the ages of 10 and 20

• African, Asian and Polynesian skins are more prone to ke-loid scarring

• Certain areas of the body are more at risk of poor scarring, such as the sternum, bony areas, shoulders, and earlobes
ACNE AND ATROPHIC SCARS:
• Atrophic scars take the form of a depression or recess in
the skin, which have a pitted appearance

• Commonly caused by inflammatory conditions such as acne,
chickenpox or trauma resulting from surgery or accidents

• The cause of this recessed wound is due to the loss of the
underlying support structure, such as fat tissue or muscle STRETCH MARKS:
• Also known as “Straie Distensae”

• Stretch Marks are fine scars caused by tearing in the der-
mis manifesting as reddish, purple striae

• The tearing is caused when skin is stretched rapidly to the
point of breakdown, and the underlying structure of the skin is unable to reform quickly enough and support the area put under tension, at which time straie start to show through the epidermis.

NEW SCARS:
• Plastic surgeons have for many years found that taping new
scars using microporous paper tape applied immediately following suture removal has resulted in a reduction in scar width and thickness.

• The tape applies sufficient pressure required to support the wound and the Scar Repair Forté is applied over the top of the tape. Plast Reconstr Surg. 1995 Dec;96(7):1715-8.

• One may apply Scar Repair Forté alone and if so it is rec-ommended that one massage with gentle pressure to the scar and surrounding area 2 to 4 times daily, more often for children. Continue daily application until the scar becomes flattened and paler.

• Apply Scar Repair Forté OVER THE TOP of microporous pa-per tape. (If one experiences any reaction to the tape then use the cream alone.)

• It is advised that to achieve ultimate benefit from the scar care programme, particularly if one has a history of scarring badly, or the scar is over a bony area, the chest, joints, breasts or from ‘tummy tuck’ surgery etc. one should tape down the scar, where possible.

• Micropore paper tape following suture removal. For lipectomy (tummy tuck) for example it is more es-sential to tape the scar and apply Scar repair Forté over 4 times daily if one is to achieve the best re-sult. The abdominal area undergoes a lot of move-ment, stretching forces, friction from clothing, so it is advised to tape this type of wound. The width of the tape must be sufficient so as to cover and support the scar completely.

DIRECTIONS FOR USE: 1. The tape should be applied to a clean scar and there must
be no greasiness on the surrounding skin. 2. The tape should be applied firmly and should overlap the
scar by at least 0.5cm at each end. 3. The Scar Repair Forté is then applied sparingly to the surface of the tape, down
the centre on top of the tape, avoiding the edges and ends so as not to cause stickiness and lack of tape adhesion. The cream impregnates the tape and is gradually released onto the scar.
4. The tape must be left on the scar until it comes off naturally (approximately 4 to 5 days ideally). 5. One should bath or shower with the tape in place. 6. Once the tape shows signs of lifting it should be very gently removed, if possible
soaking in a bath, so as not to cause any inflammation. 7. One must not put tape on and remove on a daily basis as this causes too much irritation. 8. One should continue the procedure of taping with the Scar Repair Forté over the
top until the scar becomes paler and flat, indicating maturation. One should tape where possible, or if necessary, particularly if one is known to devel-op ugly scars, for a couple of months, especially scars in certain potentially problem areas as mentioned, and particularly if there is a lot of friction or movement, after which one should use the Scar Repair Forté alone a couple of times daily. The length of time would vary from person to person.

This also depends on the position of the scar and certain areas tend to heal more slowly and can develop stretched or thickened scars. One should also note that smokers heal much more slowly. OLD SCARS: 1. If a scar is flat or stretched and pale (or flattened and darker in an ethnic skin) this
indicates a mature scar and there is little that can be done to improve them other than excision and deal with a new scar.
2. One should note that excision of a scar usually leaves one with a slightly larger scar. This must always be discussed with your doctor.

• If a scar is pink, purple, raised, itchy and painful this indicates an immature, hyper-

### Notes
about it.

• If the scar is very raised and keloid and in an area possible for taping then use the same procedure as for new scars applying over the top of the tape 4 times daily.

• If the scar cannot be taped one should massage the Scar Repair Forté, applying pressure into the scarred area 4 times daily. This should be continued until the scar becomes paler and flatter.
BURNS: Burns must be assessed and treated initially by a doctor. However, once a burn is no longer at risk of infection one may begin to apply Scar Repair Forté to the scarred area 4 times daily to accelerate healing, help prevent hardening and pigmentation of the skin. One may also apply RégimA Laser Repairing Gel over the top of the Scar Repair Forté.

STRETCH MARKS: Stretch marks occur for many reasons and some skins are more susceptible than others. Stretch marks are fine scars caused by tearing in the dermis (living layer of skin). The der-mis is where our skin produces collagen and elastin fibres that give it a firmer, younger appearance.

• The scars occur when skin is stretched to the point of break-
down, like elastic losing elasticity, at which point these tears start to show through the epidermis.

• If stretch marks are still pink or purple Scar Repair Forté Complex may help repair the damaged scar tissue as well as prevent further stretching. It is an effective re-pair and preventative treatment.

• Obviously the oilier or younger the skin, the more elastic it is and therefore the skin’s re-sponse is quicker because it needs less elastic proteins to repair.

• Therefore the drier and less elastic the skin, the more long-term Anti-Stretch treatment is required.
Stretch marks cannot be eliminated completely. However, it has been seen in clinical practice that one can make them look a lot better and correct early care lessens the impact and helps prevent further damage.

• Our aim is to deeply nourish the skin to start with, pene-
trate through to the dermis and help in the healing pro-cess, thicken and re-elasticize.

• With continued use the skin will become stronger, more supple and elastic, giving one the ability to stretch more without damage.

• Anti-Stretch penetrates through the epidermis (outer horny

## TREATMENT
## SEVERE BURNS TREATED WITH RégimA SCAR REPAIR FORTÉ SERUM + LASER AZU-REPAIR GEL:
Patient in her late 70s, burns to back, buttocks, right arm. This was her back 6 weeks post severe burn. In ICU treatment was with L-Mesitran Dressings and then Acticote. Healing was retarded and dressings caused excrutiating pain, not only on applica-tion but constant.

Area on the buttocks (not shown) turned black due to the silver in Acticote. Healing was so slow and poor with L-Mesitran and Acticote. Surgeon changed to RégimA Scar Repair Forte Super Strength Serum + Laser Azu-Re-pair Blue Gel applied onto Jelonet dressings. This was the result after only 4 weeks of dressings every 3 days. Progress was seen after only the first 3 days.
THE RÉGIMA ZONE
## No Animal Ingredients No Ingredients or Products Tested on Animals ALL ZONE AND SPAZONE PRODUCTS EXCEPT FOR THE ZONE LASER AZU-REPAIR, SPAZONE ACTIVE FACIAL AND BODY OILS, ARE PRESERVED WITH: Phenoxyethanol (and) Caprylyl Glycol from France - Highest quality/standards and strictest regulations in the world. Phenoxyethanol (and) Caprylyl Glycol from France – Highest quality/standards and strictest regulations in the world. Phenoxyethanol is a preservative ingredient used extensively in the cosmetics industry. It exhibits broad-spectrum anti-bacterial activity at exceptionally low quantities, and so is ideal for cosmetic formulations as an all-round preservative, and is considered a far superior alternative to potentially harmful formaldehyde-releasing preservatives. Phenoxyethanol is a glycol ether, which is synthesized to be a “nature identical” com-pound mimicking the same properties, function and structure as the naturally derived analogue which occurs in roses and certain other plants. It is in no way similar to eth-anol alcohol. The structure of Phenoxyethanol is entirely different to ethanol alcohol, and any commonality construed is entirely by virtue of its name being similar. Caprylyl Glycol is a plant derived skin-conditioning agent working synergistically with-in a preservative blend as it has anti-bacterial properties capable of inhibiting the growth of bacteria, helping prevent contamination and infection. In addition caprylyl glycol is a humectant that lends moisturisation and emollience.

FACTS and why one requires RégimA Micro-Molecular Ingredients to provide Powerful Essential Antioxidants, Anti-Inflammatories and new high technologically advanced ingredients to achieve Skin Health? Interesting Information About Antioxidants: It has been proven recently by British scientists that most of the hype about consuming vast quantities of fruits and vege-tables that one believes are going to boost the antioxidants in the body is absolute nonsense, costs excessive amounts of money, provides no extra benefit, and can potentially cause damage to the liver.
### Notes
ble, lovely we were so pleased. However, at the next stage of further testing what happens? Once the beautiful Blueberries are released from the stomach into the intestine, shockingly they immediately turn brown, break down, degrade almost totally the moment this ‘so-called’ power fruit starts the journey into the digestive tract, where these powerful nutrients are then supposedly going to be extracted and utilised by the body. There was only a staggering remaining 1% activity.

Antioxidants and Vitamin Supplements: If people are normally nourished, in other words, they are not anorexic or bulimic (and there is no pathology), then there should not be the need for extra supplementation. This is all expensive hype which hurts your pocket and can seriously affect your health. The true bottom line is that the extra supplementation, if not required by the body, (and would only be due to poor nutrition), means:
• Very expensive urine.

• Serious Stress on the liver as supplements are pressurising the liver to breakdown
and store. The liver has enough to deal with without having to have an overload of extra vita-mins etc that it must try and breakdown and then have to store This is not good for the liver, therefore not a good thing for the body in general. If you are taking in enough nutrients in your diet, don’t overload your body and make it work harder, unnecessarily. One vitamin may be OK if it is the daily recommended dose, but that does not mean that 1 is OK so 5 is going to be so much better. Stop! Nourish your bodies from the outside with RégimA, providing the right dose of antiox-idants, anti-inflammatories and anti-ageing excellence with no side effects whatso-ever. These micromolecular elements are penetrating and working at a cellular level rapidly and efficiently and very importantly, safely, getting to the periphery of the skin, the body is ‘treated’ wherever the products are applied topically, which is something most supplements do not reach It is just as crazy as that standard saying, “Drink 8 glasses of water a day” and “flush out the kidneys”. This is absolute nonsense and can actually cause more harm than good. If one is naturally well hydrated with your tea, coffee, juice, water, wine etc, during the day, then it is really not necessary to bombard the body with lots of extra volume of water.

Far too much water is not helping but can actually, and has been reported to, “drown” the person. Yes, people have died from over consumption of water! Bear in mind also that the body is a finely tuned machine and another of those amazing parts is the kidneys. They can work so well, naturally ‘flushing’ out toxins and really do not, and should not (unless there is some pathology) have to deal with extra volumes of liquids. Don’t put pressure on the kidneys, they will naturally detoxify. (See information on Autophagy in the section regarding Urban Stress Detox and O2-Purifyer detoxifying products) RégimA products are loaded with essential Antioxidants and Anti-Inflammatories. These are in the form of micromolecular active ingredients. The topical application of these high technology, inter-penetrating actives, ensures that your body is receiv-ing essential anti-ageing excellence, at its finest, pure and safe. See the difference.
### Notes
necessary to adulterate the skin. The products have been formulated to penetrate rapidly into the dermis, no extra assistance required! If you still wish to combine with this type of treatment then feel free, but understand that RégimA advanced formu-lations will be in that skin before you can even prepare your needling! Love it, enjoy the results you are going to be achieving.

What Are Galactomannans?: They are reserve polysaccharides. Polysaccharides, also known as Cinderella of biopolymers, are extracted or isolated from plant seed sources and hold a wide range of different functions. Sometimes they behave as an energy storage, act as protective substances (anti-bacterial), and contribute to the structural integrity and mechanical strength of plant tissues by forming a hydrated cross-linked three-dimensional network.
FOLLOW THIS PAMPERING TRAIL TO A MOST AMAZING EXPERIENCE WITH A DIFFERENCE - AN ACTUAL VISIBLE DIFFERENCE
Throughout the SpaZone range one will notice there are certain ingredients that are used in more than one product. These actives are parts of new age complexes and they are utilised in different percentages and various combinations throughout, some in cream formulations, others in gels. Each combination provides exciting new benefits, offering many more strings to your therapeutic bows! World first, Biological Engineering, has taken natural active ingredients, plants and al-gae, that have demonstrated tenacity in the world’s harshest climates, environments, and transformed them into life changing ingredients. This metamorphosis of nature’s finest now provides us with the most amazing anti-ageing ingredients ever. New biotechnology takes organic materials, such as plants, and, by a specialised pro-cess called bio-conversion, or bio-transformation, extracts active substances.

An ex-ample is regarding lactic acid and milk protein, which is derived from plant lactic pro-tein fermentation. RégimA does NOT use milk derived from animals, only from plants. RégimA now offers anti-ageing excellence and skin health whilst pampering, and will be sure to wet all appetites. All SpaZone products are safe and suitable for all skin types. There are also home care products that provide continuity of care, as always with RégimA.

What is Autophagy and Why Is It So Important? In 2016 the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Profes-sor Yoshinori Ohsumi (Tokyo Institute of Technology) for the discovery of the mechanism for Autophagy, one of the key ways in which the cells in our body destroy and recycle unwanted or dam-aged cellular material.
### Notes
known as autophagy plays a key role and promotes healthy ageing. Autophagy means “self-eating.” Your cells devour dead, diseased, or worn-out cells and utilise them for energy or to make new cell parts. This natural ‘recycling programme’ allows the body to eliminate toxins whilst playing a critical role in reducing inflammation, slowing down the ageing process, making us more efficient machines to get rid of faulty parts, help stop metabolic dysfunction like obesity and diabetes. RégimA SpaZone Detoxifying and Purifying treatments target autophagy. TRIALS: Human volunteers were exposed to a solution of nicotine to determine the detoxify-ing potential of this product and the active ingredients. On testing, presented a con-siderable detoxifying effect for human fibroblasts. Chlorine and exhaust gases were also trialled to test the efficiency for limiting inflammation caused by these pollutants.

Elevated detoxifying activation was exhibited. The chelating (removal of metals) ca-pacity towards metal ions such as iron and lead was considerable. pH of Product: 5.3 DIRECTIONS FOR USE: (In-Salon 200ml) To be used as part of a RégimA in-salon treatment. Following a RégimA Peel or facial, apply eye care then a layer of O2-Purifyer Serum to all treated areas. Allow to dry to a film, one may then, if desired, also apply a thin layer of Marine Replenish Masque with fingertips to face and neck, avoiding the eye area, to finalise a purifying, hydrating, replenishing treatment.

### Notes
produced by fermentation of sugar. The exotic prickly pear, uniquely stimulates 2 enzymes in the stratum corneum (epidermis), responsible for the body’s natural exfo-liation process, which slows down with age. Purified chestnut stimulates cell turnover and synthesis of fatty acids and ceramides, achieved through enzymatic action, enhancing, normalising, re-structuring.

Significantly activates cell renewal, gently, yet powerfully. Skin rapidly looks and feels smoother, re-elastisized, more youthful and glowing. STAR INGREDIENTS:

### SLIMMING SCULPTING SOLUTION
LIFT – FIRM – TONE – SLIM – SCULPT
A synergy of powerful bio-actives has been shown to limit the development of fat masses, particularly in the abdomen and thighs, not forgetting those less than firm upper arms, helping facilitate elimination of fat, stimulating lipolytic activity (breaking down of fat) of adipocytes (fat cells). A new slenderizing strategy, short and long term, is obtained from the synergy of spe-cific plant polyphenols, providing a dual action, stimulating biological cell functions against mechanical stress, by tightening the dermal fibre network. Skin regains elas-ticity and tone, restoring curve contour.

If the body is slenderising it is important that restoration of skin’s natural stretching response is achieved simultaneously. Advanced Natural technology is the key to successful body sculpting, ingredient synergy offering – Lifting – Firming – Toning – Slenderising – Sculpting. All in one magical treatment.
### Notes
It is critical, particularly if one is losing weight, to combine with this toning treatment Prior to a series of treatments, the therapist should measure around the abdomen, thighs and inner knees, marking and photographing if possible, to ensure measure-ments are always at the same level.

These SpaZone prod-ucts are leave-on treatments that work synergistically.
### TARGET CELLULITE
## TARGET CELLULITE SILHOUETTE CONTOURING COMPLEX
90% of women have cellulite, the hormone, oestrogen, being a major culprit, stimulat-ing metabolic activity of adipocytes (fat cells). Fat, fluids and toxins are trapped under the skin, fat is compressed, circulation is hampered, causing an orange peel effect. It is the quality of a woman’s skin and age, rather than the quantity of fat in their thighs, that determines whether cellulite occurs. As women mature, skin becomes thinner and cellulite looks worse. It is critical therefore that the anti-ageing factor is brought into the treatment equation.

Synergistic action of advanced cellulite solutions, plus anti-ageing excellence, is the key. Engineering of natural actives, isolated from an enriched fraction of bitter or-ange tree, facilitates progressive elimination of oedema (fluid retention), stimulates microcirculation by vaso-dilatation and decongestion. Sacred lotus, breaks down fat storage, limits formation of new fat cells. The addition of a Natural biopolymer has a tensor, lifting, anti-wrinkle effect, smoothing and visibly elastisizing, improving contour, plus the look and feel of lack lustre skin. STAR INGREDIENTS:

ty acids and mobilising of stored fats.
### Notes
gested and the appearance of spongy cellulite is clearly improved.

• Human trial volunteers exhibited a significant increase in skin micro-circulation, showing progressive elimination of oedema.

• Dermal density – In Trials 79% showed a significant increase in the density of the dermis of the treated thigh, a reflection of the reduc-tion of fat infiltration.
SACRED LOTUS (NELUMBO NUCIFERA LEAF EXTRACT):
• An aquatic plant rich in flavonols offers Triple Action anti-cellulite approach

• Ultra powerful active ingredient targeting cellulite and drainage.

• Activates lipolysis (breakdown of fat) and the elimination of lipids.

• Reduces fat storage by activating lipolysis and boosting the synthesis
of the universal gene for caloric restriction: SIRT-1 Adiponectin

• Limits adipose tissue (fat tissue) inflammation by stimulating the ex-
pression of adiponectin, the Gene for caloric restriction, and inhibits fat cell differentiation.
Why regular use of Target Cellulite is extremely important? Adiponectin – The Universal Gene For Caloric Restriction Fat cells (Adiopcytes) are biologically active, and their function or dysfunction may affect our health in many ways. For example, fat cells produce and secrete import-ant biologic substances. In the 1990s, scientists found a protein secreted by adipo-cytes and named it adiponectin. Although secreted only from adipose (fat) tissue, it was found that plasma con-centration of adiponectin is much lower in obese people. Unfortunately low levels of adi-ponectin are associated with in-flammation, lipid abnormalities, insulin resistance and increased risk of diabetes, coronary heart disease and cancer. Adiponectin is a hormone pro-duced by your fat cells so you cannot just take a supplement that is going to do this job.

It is amazing that this hormone, if stimulated in the correct way, burns its fat cells for fuel. To the rescue comes RégimA SpaZone Target Cellulite. Regular application stimulates expression of the Adiponec-tin Gene, bringing up those all important levels and burning those dreaded fat cells. TRIALS: Human trials, in the absence of weight loss, revealed significant reduction in thigh and hip circumference, as well as importantly abdominal circumference. There was a marked increase in dermal density of the treated thigh, which is a reflection of the reduction of fat infiltration. pH of Product: 5.7
### Notes
Cleanse the body of cream and oil, except SpaZone O2-Purifyer Serum if undertaking a combined treatment. Ensure the body is warm as this will aid penetration. Massage briskly a layer of Complex to all areas prone to cellulite, thighs, buttocks, abdomen and inner knees.

Then very gently ensure areas of lymph drainage are covered, targeting mainly behind knees, groin, armpits, upto the neck. Leave treat-ment on. One may apply Slimming Sculpting Solution to target areas over the top.

ShiiTake mushrooms, rich in oligosaccharides, anti-inflammatories, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals, fortify firmness and tonicity, whilst lightening un-even skin colour. Increased elasticity is achieved by limiting degradation of collagen I and III fibres, thereby reducing skin fatigability. Remodelling of the contours of the neck and breasts, increasing density and firmness is ultimate anti-ageing, achieved by boosting natural actives, in the form of phytonu-trients, including purified black pepper berries, proven to restore elasticity, tightness, smoothing, improving colour and texture.

The combination of firming and contouring precious actives results in a firmer, more youthful looking skin. Regular use will help keep the skin in optimal condition. Recommended for treatment of Hyperpigmentation DIRECTIONS FOR USE: (Home Care 50ml) AM & PM: Cleanse with RégimA, apply eye care products. Apply a thin layer of Neck + Breast Complex to neck, décolleté and breasts. To be followed daily by applica-tion of a RégimA day product containing sun protection.
### TARGET CELLULITE
## SILHOUETTE CONTOURING COMPLEX
[SEE ALSO IN-SALON/SPA TREATMENT] 90% of women have cellulite, the hormone, oestrogen, being a major culprit, stim-ulating metabolic activity of adipocytes (fat cells). Fat, fluids and toxins are trapped under the skin, fat is compressed, circulation is hampered, causing an orange peel effect. It is the quality of a woman’s skin and age, rather than the quantity of fat in their thighs, that determines whether cellulite occurs.

As women mature, skin becomes thinner and cellulite looks worse. It is critical therefore that the anti-ageing factor is brought into the treatment equation. Synergistic action of advanced cellulite solutions, plus anti-ageing excellence, is the key. Engineering of natural actives, isolated from an enriched fraction of bitter or-ange tree, facilitates progressive elimination of oedema (fluid retention), stimulates

tensor, lifting, anti-wrinkle effect, smoothing and visibly elastisizing, improving contour, plus the look and feel of lack lustre skin. DIRECTIONS FOR USE: (Home Care 100ml) AM or PM: Cleanse the body of any cream and oil. If the body is warm following a bath or shower this aids penetration.

Massage briskly a layer of Complex to all areas prone to cellulite, thighs, buttocks, abdomen and inner knees. Then very gently ensure areas of lymph drainage (where toxins are eliminated) are covered, targeting mainly behind knees, groin, armpits, upto the neck. Leave treatment on. One may apply Slimming Sculpting Solution to target areas over the top.
### SLIMMING SCULPTING SOLUTION
LIFT – FIRM – TONE – SLIM – SCULPT
[SEE ALSO IN-SALON/SPA TREATMENT] A synergy of powerful bio-actives has been shown to limit the development of fat masses, particularly in the abdomen and thighs, not forgetting those less than firm upper arms, helping facilitate elimination of fat, stimulating lipolytic activity (breaking down of fat) of adipocytes (fat cells). A new slenderizing strategy, short and long term, is obtained from the synergy of spe-cific plant polyphenols, providing a dual action, stimulating biological cell functions against mechanical stress, and, by tightening the dermal fibre network. Skin regains elasticity and tone, restoring curve contour. If the body is slenderising it is important that restoration of skin’s natural stretching response is achieved simultaneously. Advanced Natural technology is the key to successful body sculpting, ingredient synergy offering – Lifting – Firming – Toning – Slenderising – Sculpting.

All in one magical treatment. With continued treatments one can experience a decrease in oedema, thigh and abdominal circumference, dermal tightening, helping regain elasticity and tone. DIRECTIONS FOR USE: (Home Care 100ml) Cleanse the body of cream and oil, except SpaZone Target Cellulite, which may be used in combination. Gently massage a thin layer of Cream Solution to target areas such as thighs, inner knees, abdomen, upper arms. A cooling sensation may be felt. These SpaZone prod-ucts are leave-on treatments that work synergistically.

### Notes
## ALL ZONE AND SPAZONE PRODUCTS EXCEPT FOR THE ZONE LASER AZU-REPAIR, SPAZONE ACTIVE FACIAL AND BODY OILS, ARE PRESERVED WITH: Phenoxyethanol (and) Caprylyl Glycol from France - Highest quality/standards and strictest regulations in the world. Phenoxyethanol (and) Caprylyl Glycol from France – Highest quality/standards and strictest regulations in the world. Phenoxyethanol is a preservative ingredient used extensively in the cosmetics industry. It exhibits broad-spectrum anti-bacterial activity at exceptionally low quantities, and so is ideal for cosmetic formulations as an all-round preservative, and is considered a far superior alternative to potentially harmful formaldehyde-releasing preservatives. Phenoxyethanol is a glycol ether, which is synthesized to be a “nature identical” com-pound mimicking the same properties, function and structure as the naturally derived analogue which occurs in roses and certain other plants. It is in no way similar to eth-anol alcohol. The structure of Phenoxyethanol is entirely different to ethanol alcohol, and any commonality construed is entirely by virtue of its name being similar. Caprylyl Glycol is a plant derived skin-conditioning agent working synergistically with-in a preservative blend as it has anti-bacterial properties capable of inhibiting the growth of bacteria, helping prevent contamination and infection. In addition caprylyl glycol is a humectant that lends moisturisation and emollience.
